- **Machine coding interviews for front-end developers.**
- **Problem:** Front-end developers often struggle to crack the machine coding round.
- **Why?** This video explores the reasons and solutions.


### **Key topics covered:**
  - What matters in a machine coding round.
  - Tips and tricks for cracking it.
  - **Scenario:** One or two-hour coding problem statement.

---

## Key Steps for Machine Coding Rounds

### **Planning**
- Read the problem statement carefully.
- **Common Mistake:** Asking questions mid-way instead of at the beginning.
- Prioritize **must-have** and **good-to-have** features based on the problem statement.

### **Data Model Understanding**
- Identify API, GraphQL, REST, or mock APIs.
- Understand data models and protocols.
- Proper data model understanding simplifies coding.

### **Component Design**
- Define common components and services.
- Separate concerns and avoid mixing logic.
- Focus on performance optimization during coding.

### **Consistency and Accessibility**
- Avoid code duplication.
- Utilize design systems.
- Implement small accessibility features like `tab` and `aria-label` attributes.

## Prioritization in Machine Coding Rounds

| Priority            | Focus Area                                  |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Highest Priority**| Must-have features and code quality.        |
| **Secondary**       | Performance, consistency, and accessibility.|
| **Post-Round**      | Discuss other improvements during walkthrough.|

## Common Interview Expectations

### **Folder Structure**
- **Flat Structure:** Separate folders for components, actions, reducers, etc.
- **Domain-Driven:** Group related functionality within a single domain folder.
- **Atomic Design:** Build from smallest units (atoms) to full web pages.

### **Separation of Concerns**
- Decouple dependencies.
- Avoid duplication.
- Ensure extensibility.

### **Naming Conventions**
- Consistent variable, file, and function names.
- Use uniform product terminology.

---

## Focus on Modular Code

### **Atomic Design**
- Build small reusable components.
- Combine them to create larger structures.

### **State Management**
- Use libraries like Redux, MobX, or Context API.
- Define clear state models and interfaces.

---

## Design Patterns

- Familiarize with:
  - Factory Method
  - Singleton
  - Observer Pattern
- Understand their use in real-world scenarios.

---

## Interview Round Tips

### **Time Management**
- Balance planning and execution.
- Monitor the clock and adjust pace.

### **Ready to Code From Scratch**
- Be prepared for:
  - Writing code without IDE support.
  - Using plain text editors or whiteboards.

### **Brush Up Basics**
- Common DOM APIs (`addEventListener`, etc.).
- CSS properties (e.g., box model, position).

---

## Code Walkthrough

### **Steps:**
1. Start with the bootstrap/init section (e.g., `index.html`).
2. Highlight your approach and challenging areas.
3. Discuss your thought process and future plans.

### **Addressing Questions:**
- **Performance:**
  - Event delegation, re-rendering optimization, etc.
- **Consistency:**
  - Modularization and common components.
- **Security:**
  - XSS, CSRF, CORS issues.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Use of `tabindex`, `aria-label`, etc.

---

### Final Tip
- **Your Code Speaks:** Let your code quality and approach shine.
- **Be Vocal:** Discuss areas of improvement and alternative solutions.
