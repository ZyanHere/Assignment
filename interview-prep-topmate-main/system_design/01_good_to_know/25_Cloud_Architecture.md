# The Basics of Cloud Architecture

---


#### **Why pursue a cloud-based strategy?**

- **Hardware is expensive**
  - With cloud providers, you pay much less, sometimes nothing upfront.
  - Significant peace of mind is achieved.

#### **Advantages of migrating to the cloud include:**

- **Affordability**
  - Most providers don't charge upfront.
  - Pay-as-you-go model.

- **Professional Maintenance**
  - Compatibility and upgrades handled by the provider.
  - Quicker software deployments.

- **Security**
  - Large cloud providers benefit from economies of scale.
  - High-level security features beyond the financial reach of smaller companies.

- **Scalability**
  - Pay only for what you need.
  - Quickly scale resources up or down.

#### **Disadvantages to consider:**

- **Higher Long-Term Costs**
  - While saving upfront, hosting on the cloud may increase total cost of ownership in the long run.

- **Loss of Control**
  - Complex deployments might not be compatible with cloud configurations.

- **Vendor Lock-In**
  - Switching providers or moving off the cloud can be very challenging.

- **Industry-Specific Regulations**
  - Some cloud services may not comply with regulations like HIPAA.

- **Physical Location**
  - Legal/security reasons might require data storage in specific regions.

- **Air Gapping**
  - For high-security needs, ensure systems arenâ€™t connected to external networks.

#### **Three Strategies for Moving from On-Premise to Cloud-Based Hosting**

1. **Re-Hosting (Lift and Shift)**
   - Simply shift data from on-premise infrastructure to the cloud.
   - **Pros:**
     - Simple and fast process.
     - Availability of automation tools.
   - **Cons:**
     - Legacy software might not be compatible.

2. **Re-Platforming (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)**
   - Re-hosting with minor tweaks to capture full cloud benefits.
   - **Pros:**
     - Captures cloud migration benefits with minimal effort.
   - **Cons:**
     - Requires careful management to avoid resource-intensive refactoring.

3. **Refactoring**
   - Fully re-architect applications for the cloud.
   - Often a last resort or strategic choice, e.g., moving from monolithic to microservices architecture.
   - **Pros:**
     - Increased speed, scalability, and performance.
   - **Cons:**
     - Most difficult, expensive, and time-consuming.
     - Risky and potentially disruptive if mismanaged.

#### **How does this help you with interviews?**

- **Interviewing with a Cloud Provider:**
  - Understand product offerings and compare them to competitors.

- **System Design Questions:**
  - Reflect on real business needs.
  - Learn the landscape of cloud services.

- **Interviewing at a Company Without Cloud Adoption:**
  - Discuss on-premise vs. cloud topics.
  - Showcase big-picture thinking.
  - Highlight trade-offs around cost and engineering effort.
