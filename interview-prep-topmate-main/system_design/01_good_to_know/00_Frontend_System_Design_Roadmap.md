### Key Concepts in Frontend System Design

- Communication between browser (application) and server
- Understanding networking basics

#### Networking for Freshers vs Seniors:
- **Freshers/Early Engineers**:  
  - Know how the **web works**  
  - Basics of DNS, routers, ISP roles, etc.

- **Seniors**:  
  - Understand **HTML/CSS rendering**, DOM, layout computation  
  - Dive deeper into **cumulative layout shift**, layouting, and rendering tree.

---


### Protocols to Learn:

#### For Freshers:  
- Basics of **HTTP/HTTPS**  
- Understanding REST APIs  

#### For Seniors:  
- Advanced concepts: **HTTP/2**, **HTTP/3**, **TCP/UDP**, **SMTP**, **FTP**  
- In-depth understanding of REST API headers, content types, and status codes  
- Contribution to GraphQL: Queries, mutations, data loaders, and batching

### Communication Techniques

#### Freshers:  
- Basics of **real-time data fetching**:  
  - **Short Polling**  
  - **WebSocket consumption**  

#### Seniors:  
- Advanced techniques:  
  - **Long Polling**, **Server-Sent Events**, **WebSockets**, **Webhooks**  
  - Real-time systems optimization

---


### Security and Performance

#### Security for Freshers:  
- Input/Output sanitization  
- Awareness of **XSS**, **CSRF tokens**  
- Basics of HTTPS and CORS

#### Security for Seniors:  
- Understanding **Authentication (Auth)**  
- Implementing secure headers (**HTTP-only cookies**, secure flags)  
- **SRI** and **Permission Policies**  
- Dependency management for avoiding vulnerabilities

---

### Performance Optimization

#### Metrics to Track:  
- Build, network, and asset optimization  
- JavaScript and framework-specific optimization

#### Tools:  
- Monitoring tools  
- Framework-specific tweaks for performance enhancement  

#### Rendering Patterns:  
- **CSR**, **SSR**, **Static Site Generation (SSG)**  
- React server components  

---


### Caching and State Management

#### Databases in Frontend:
- Local Storage, Session Storage, Cookies  
- IndexedDB for offline support  

#### Senior-Level Skills:  
- Network caching: **Cache-Control**, **E-Tag**, **Last-Modified**  
- Service Workers and API layer caching  

---


### Testing Approaches

#### For Freshers:  
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions  
- Basics of Test-Driven Development (**TDD**)

#### For Seniors:  
- Advanced tools like **Cypress**, **Playwright**, and **Selenium**  
- Writing **E2E tests** and **Component Testing**  

---


### Accessibility for All

- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Navigate using only the keyboard  
- Screen readers and proper ARIA roles  
- Color contrast testing for inclusive design  

---


### Logging and Monitoring

#### For Freshers:  
- Log key actions and user flows  

#### For Seniors:  
- Set up **alerts**, debug effectively, and prioritize issues  

---

### System Design Practice

#### For Freshers:  
- Low-Level Design (**LLD**):  
  - State management  
  - Routing  
  - Solid Principles  

#### For Seniors:  
- High-Level Design (**HLD**):  
  - Applications like **Facebook Feeds**, **Live Commentaries**, **Photo Sharing Apps**  
  - Concepts of **Media Streaming** and **Real-Time Collaboration**
