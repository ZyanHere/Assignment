#### **Tip #1: Clarify the Requirements**  
- **System Design Questions:** Often very vague.  
- **Example Question:** *"How would you design Instagram?"*  
  - Instagram is a huge app with many features.  
  - **Steps to Clarify:**  
    1. Restate the prompt.  
    2. Gather more information.  
    3. Make assumptions about core features (if unclear).  
- **Core Features for Instagram:**  
  - Uploading images from a mobile client.  
  - Ability to follow other users.  
  - Generating a feed.  
- **Scale Acknowledgment:**  
  - **Assumption:** 10 million users.  
  - **Usage Stats:** Uploading 2 photos/month (5 MB/photo).  
- Write these requirements as bullets on the whiteboard.

- After defining requirements:  
  - Treat each idea separately.  
  - Start by clarifying requirements for a more organized and structured answer.

#### **Tip #2: Define Your Data Model**  
- **Importance:** Different data types need unique storage and access methods.  
- **Relational Data Example:**  
  - Draw a table with:  
    - **Two Columns:**  
      1. ID  
      2. Data  
  - **For Instagram Users:**  
    - Store: Username, Location, Email Address (as strings).

#### **Tip #3: Take Notes on Decisions**  
- Write down all decisions on the whiteboard.  
- Clearly communicate trade-offs for each decision:  
  - Star, Circle, or Underline them.  
- Example:  
  - Chose to model user data with a relational database.  
  - Non-relational alternative was considered but not pursued.  
- **Pro Tip:** Dedicate a corner of the whiteboard for note-taking.  
  - Refer frequently to prevent rambling or forgetting information.

#### **Tip #4: Diagram Your Design**  
- Start with the simplest design.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Explain how components relate to each other.  
  2. Tie components back to earlier-defined requirements.  
  3. Gradually elaborate and add components for scaling and optimization.  
- **Visuals:**  
  - Components: Simple shapes.  
  - Relationships: Arrows.  
  - **Conventions:**  
    - Databases: Represented as cylinders.  
    - Label everything for clarity.  
- **Practice Drawing + Speaking Simultaneously:** Essential for the interview.  
- **Starting Points:**  
  - User/Mobile Client: Explain data flow to the server.  
  - Alternatively: Start with the database and work backward.

#### **Tip #5: Keep Things Legible**  
- Ensure your writing and designs are comprehensible.  
- **Actionable Tip:** Maintain **white space** between points/diagrams.  
- **Objective:**  
  - Make your diagrams easy to follow.  
  - Avoid overwhelming the interviewer.

#### **Final Thoughts**  
- System design interviews can be intimidating but are manageable with practice.  
- **Whiteboarding:** Can become an enjoyable experience.  
- **Action Steps:**
