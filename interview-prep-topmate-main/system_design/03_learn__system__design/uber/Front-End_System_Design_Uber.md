## User Interface (UI)

### Map Elements

- **Taxis Location:**
  - Displays taxis in the vicinity.
- **User Location:**
  - Indicates the user's position.
- **Zoom Level:**
  - Map renders based on the zoom level.
- **Bounding Box:**
  - Limits map data to relevant areas.

---

## API Design

### Key Communication Methods

1. **REST API:**
   - For request-response operations.
2. **Server-Sent Events:**
   - One-way communication from server to client.
3. **WebSockets:**
   - Bi-directional, real-time communication.

### Endpoints

1. **Real-Time Taxi Locations:**
   - Endpoint: `server-events/cars`
   - Fetches taxi locations using bounding box and zoom level.
2. **Ride Status Updates:**
   - Endpoint: `server-events/request-updates`
   - Provides updates on ride requests (status, driver ID, ETA).
3. **Real-Time Ride Tracking:**
   - Endpoint: `server-events/ride-tracking`
   - Provides continuous updates on ride location and zoom level.

### WebSocket

- **Driver-User Communication:**
  - Endpoint: `websockets/user-chat/{rideID}`
  - Facilitates messaging between driver and user.

### REST Endpoints

1. **Request Ride:**
   - Endpoint: `api/ride/request`
   - Inputs: Pickup location, destination, ride type, payment type.
   - Response: Ride ID.
2. **Cancel Ride:**
   - Endpoint: `api/ride/cancel/{rideID}`
   - Response: Status and message.
3. **Complete Ride:**
   - Endpoint: `api/ride/complete/{rideID}`
   - Response: Amount, currency, status.
4. **Fetch Past Trips:**
   - Endpoint: `api/rides/{userID}`
   - Response: List of past trips.
5. **Save/Get Favorites:**
   - Endpoint: `api/favorites/{userID}`
   - Response: Array of favorite locations.
6. **Schedule Ride:**
   - Endpoint: `api/ride/schedule`
   - Inputs: Pickup location, destination, time.

## Optimization

### Performance Improvements

1. **Map Tile Optimization:**
   - Use vector tiles for better zooming and performance.
2. **Caching:**
   - Cache map tiles for frequently visited areas.
3. **Adjust Map Quality:**
   - Serve lower resolution tiles for poor network connections.
4. **Reduce Features:**
   - Simplify map data in areas with low connectivity.
5. **Prefetching:**
   - Load map data ahead of user navigation.
6. **Icon Clustering:**
   - Group icons as the user zooms out to reduce visual clutter.
7. **Progressive Web App (PWA):**
   - Provide offline functionality and faster load times.

## Accessibility

### Key Features

1. **Screen Reader Compatibility:**
   - Ensure all elements are readable by screen readers.
2. **Contrast:**
   - Sufficient contrast for text and backgrounds.
   - Include dark, light, and high-contrast themes.
3. **Touchable Areas:**
   - Increase touchable area for buttons and interactive elements.
4. **Voice Commands:**
   - Enable navigation using voice commands.
5. **Font Size Adjustability:**
   - Allow users to customize font sizes.
6. **Minimize Flashing Elements:**
   - Avoid rapidly flashing elements to prevent issues for photosensitive users.
7. **Feedback Mechanisms:**
   - Provide haptic or audio feedback for actions.
8. **Multiple Navigation Methods:**
   - Enable navigation using swipes, buttons, or voice.
9. **Error-Friendly Forms:**
