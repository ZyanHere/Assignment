- **Key takeaway:** Networking bridges the gap for job seekers and recruiters.

---

- **Advice for LinkedIn Profiles:**
  - Use clear and specific titles like `Aspiring .NET Developer Finishing Bootcamp`.
  - Recruiters scan for **keywords**; avoid vague titles like "aspiring software developer."
  - Bullet point advice for tech roles:
    1. **Simplify technical jargon:** Describe your work as you would to a family member.
    2. Highlight **recent applications/projects**.
    3. Include a "technologies used" summary.

---

- **Drop "Aspiring":** Replace it with specific roles like `Full Stack Developer with React Expertise`.
- **Recruiters’ Perspective:**
  - Time spent on resumes is brief—make it count.
  - **Avoid generalized titles**; provide clarity.

---

- **Featured Section on LinkedIn:**
  - Include: Portfolios, GitHub links, projects.
  - Avoid: Resume files and irrelevant documents.
  - **Tip:** Tailor your job descriptions to universal terms.

---

- **Education and Certifications:**
  - Education can be secondary to projects/experience.
  - Certifications: Highlight cloud certifications (e.g., Azure, AWS) when relevant.

---

- **Volunteer Work:**
  - Underrated but valuable for building network and profile.
  - List impactful achievements, even in non-tech roles (e.g., "Achieved 200% sales target in February").

---

- **Networking:**
  - Stop solely applying to jobs.
  - Leverage recruiters and **direct connections.**
  - Message recruiters/hiring managers on LinkedIn with personalized messages referencing their work or company.

---

  - Showcase accomplishments and projects.
  - Content helps build visibility and credibility.

---

- **Profile Review Highlights:**
  - **Titles:** Specificity is critical. Examples: `Mobile Flutter Developer`, `React Front-End Engineer`.
  - **Profile Picture:** Use a clear, professional headshot.
