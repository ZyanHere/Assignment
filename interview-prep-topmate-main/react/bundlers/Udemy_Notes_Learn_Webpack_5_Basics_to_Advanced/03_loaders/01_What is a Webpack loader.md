# Introduction to Webpack Loaders

---

## **What Are Webpack Loaders?**
- Loaders are **JavaScript libraries** designed to help you import and handle files that Asset Modules cannot manage.
- With Webpack loaders, you can import:
  - **CSS files** directly into your JavaScript.
  - **SASS** and **LESS** files.
  - **Handlebars templates.**
  - **XML** files.
  - And much more!

### **Purpose of Webpack Loaders**
- Webpack is designed to bundle all your dependencies into one or more files.
- Dependencies include:
  - Other **JavaScript modules** required by your main JavaScript file to function correctly.
  - Additional files like stylesheets, templates, and data files.

### **Extending Beyond JavaScript**
- Webpack loaders enable the inclusion of non-JavaScript files directly into your JavaScript code.
- This feature simplifies project management and ensures all necessary resources are bundled together seamlessly.
